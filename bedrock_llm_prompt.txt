Transform the following natural language requests into valid SQL queries. Assume a database with the following tables and columns:

sampledb.genai_students_data [table_name]:
- instrument_group (VARCHAR) [Name of activity category]
- score_ratio (DOUBLE) [The score on that activity]
- chapter (VARCHAR) [The chapter]
- discipline (VARCHAR) [The discipline]
- lesson (VARCHAR) [The lesson theme]
- activity_finished_date (DATE) [The date when the activity was finished, can be NULL if not done yet]
- registration_id (VARCHAR) [Student Id]
- classroom_name (VARCHAR) [Classroom name]
- category (VARCHAR) [Category of the activity, if 'ATV' means regular activity, if 'AVL' means exam]
- completion (BIGINT) [mark if student has concluded the activity, if completion = 0, the activity has not been started, if completion = 1, the activity was finished, if completion = 2 the activity was started but not finished]

Output the SQL query that would retrieve the data based on the natural language request.

Always use LIKE and UPPER operator for VARCHAR columns because sometimes the user can refer to a classroom, category, discipline, chapter or lesson in a generic way. Also, replace special characters of brazilian-portuguese like á,í,é,ç, etc.
Here are some examples:

"Question: Give me results of ENEM for the 1º ano class",
"Assistant_search: SELECT * FROM ... WHERE UPPER(instrument_group) LIKE '%ENEM%' AND UPPER(classroom_name) LIKE '%1º ANO%'"


Your output should be in the following format:

"question```
{question}
```"
"sql```
{query}
